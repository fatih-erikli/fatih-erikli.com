    <h3 role="heading">Pattern matching in Typescript</h3>
    <article role="document">
      <time>25 Dec, 2021.</time>
      <p>Pattern matching is a functional programming concept
to handle conditional code branches based on the
structured the date you are processing 
in a declarative way. Pure functional languages such as
Haskell and Erlang supports pattern matching and
most of the times it is the only way of writing a
conditional code. <s>We don't have pattern matching
in Javascript or Python, but with some syntactic sugar
and precompilers such as Typescript, we can use
pattern matching.</s> Edit: It's not a good idea. I don't recommend to implement a pattern matching in Typescript. We need to be
patient until the time pattern matching will be possible with Javascript. </p>
<p>I found a library called "ts-pattern". I tried, and it
works like a charm. By desing, pattern matching runs
on run-time, but it is also taking some advantages
of Typescript to check your types before compiling them.</p>
<p>It also warns you when you have a missing case
in your pattern matching structure and I think it is
super useful when you have to deal with complex
user interactions and multiple application modes.</p>
<p>I am going to share a code piece and I think it will worth
a thousand words to explain it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">useEffect(() =&gt;
    eventEmitter.addEventListener(&quot;all&quot;, (event) =&gt; {
      match&lt;[EventName, EventTarget, DrawingMode]&gt;([event.name, event.target, canvasState.mode])
        .with([&quot;click&quot;, &quot;canvas-area&quot;, &quot;move&quot;], () =&gt; {
          setCanvasState(&quot;mode&quot;, &quot;start&quot;);
        })  
        .with([&quot;click&quot;, &quot;draw-button&quot;, &quot;move&quot;], () =&gt; {
          setCanvasState(&quot;mode&quot;, &quot;start&quot;);
        })
        .with([&quot;click&quot;, &quot;move-button&quot;, &quot;start&quot;], () =&gt; {
          setCanvasState(&quot;mode&quot;, &quot;move&quot;);
        })
        .with([&quot;click&quot;, &quot;canvas-area&quot;, &quot;start&quot;], () =&gt; {
          console.log(&quot;create a shape&quot;)
        })
        .with([&quot;mousedown&quot;, __, __], (match) =&gt; {})
        .with([&quot;mouseup&quot;, __, __], (match) =&gt; {})
        .with([&quot;canvasmove&quot;, __, __], (match) =&gt; {})
        .with([__, __, __], (match) =&gt; {
          console.log('no matching pattern', match);
        })
        .run();
    })
  );
</code></pre>
<p>This is a useEffect example in React. We listen to all the
user events, combining them with the related part of the application,
and the application mode (it is very contextual for a vectoral drawing library, but I think it is understandable)
and creating some conditional branches.</p>
<p>We also use <code>__</code> whildcard pattern to fulfill missing parts of our patterns.</p>
<p>Here's the github repository of <code>ts-pattern</code>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern">https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern</a></p>
<h3>Edit: I implemented a minimal pattern matching library for Typescript</h3>
<p>I noticed that the runtime was a bit expensive to match all the cases with ts-pattern
and I worked a little bit to make it faster and I managed to optimize.</p>
<p>I published the library on github and npm called "pattern-select":</p>
<p>That's it.
Happy hacking!</p>

on the tests you have initially written. In traditional way of 
development, we create the application, test them manually,
and create tests or ignore them. In test-driven approach,
you create the tests and run them first, see them failing,
and start implementing the application by seeing the
tests results are passing one by one incrementally.</p></div>

between the client and server happens with some flags sent by client and server mutually.
It means, we actually don't really know which user is authenticated. User
is sending their session id via HTTP cookies and we (server) retrieve the related record
from the database, and prepare the page response with the information of
authenticated user.</p></div>
