My psychiatrist doubled the 
dose of my drug in the second month. <s>I have not been diagnosed with a psychological disorder yet.</s> 
I am just guessing, I was burned-out for the second time in my life.
As I have observed and been told by my social circle, it is almost an occupational condition
for a software engineer to be burned out once in a 5 years.
**Edit: I have been diagnosed with Generalized anxiety disorder.**

I am doing good for now.

This is a short blog post :)

Happy hacking!
