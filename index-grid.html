      <div aria-label="Description" role="contentinfo" class="post-preview"><p>Cryptology and cryptography is an interdisciplinary field of study
in computer sciences and math. Cryptography in computer 
programming, covers the techniques of secure communication in
computer systems and internet. Secure communication is not something
nice to have, but it is something must to have in our times. That's why
cryptography is an inseparable field of study in computer sciences.</p></div>

      <div aria-label="Description" role="contentinfo" class="post-preview"><p>Test driven development is the way of developing a software based
on the tests you have initially written. In traditional way of 
development, we create the application, test them manually,
and create tests or ignore them. In test-driven approach,
you create the tests and run them first, see them failing,
and start implementing the application by seeing the
tests results are passing one by one incrementally.</p></div>

      <div aria-label="Description" role="contentinfo" class="post-preview"><p>In the current state of web development, the line between backend and frontend
development has become almost invisible. The reason of that is we started to use
Javascript for both client-side and server-side after NodeJS. And furthermore,
we started to render the same components for both client-side and server side.
This is also known as SSR (server-side-rendered) applications and universal web
applications.</p></div>

      <div aria-label="Description" role="contentinfo" class="post-preview"><p>As you may already know, HTTP is a stateless protocol. The communication
between the client and server happens with some flags sent by client and server mutually.
It means, we actually don't really know which user is authenticated. User
is sending their session id via HTTP cookies and we (server) retrieve the related record
from the database, and prepare the page response with the information of
authenticated user.</p></div>
