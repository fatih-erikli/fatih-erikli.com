This was my second episode. In contrast to the previous one,
this time I was aware that I have something wrong. The self-isolation during
the pandemic and aftermath some family issues lead me to experience the second breakdown.

In my first manic episode, I was over-criticizing everything and blaming everyone around me.
I was taking stupid decisions and risks. It is like somebody else playing you on behalf of yourself,
but you are not aware of that. It becomes clear after you have passed that episode. The major incident
in my first manic episode was taking stupid decisions and gambling with my life. It lead me to
get in an accident with my bicycle and I injured myself bad. After the physical recovery, 
I withdrawn myself from everything, I felt down and depressive; opposite to the manic period, 
felt shame and guilt because of things I have done. After 6 months, I was okay and feeling normal again.

My first episode was a lesson for me and I was afraid that it is going to happen again.
My mistake was not taking a psychological support during the first episode.
My second mistake was I have not taken a support after getting over the first manic episode.

### My second episode
This time I was aware what was happening to me and I just let it go.
There was something controlling me, something like a different person
inside me just talking. That person is not me. It is like a reflection of somebody else.

I was aware that this is something temporary and I wanted to let the emotions and
everything go out; because I got no other chance. I could not continue my daily life;
there was something wrong and everyone was aware of it including me.

I looked okay when I look at myself in the mirror, but when I talk to somebody,
or when I write something down, it did not make sense. **My thoughts and the sentences
that I built was disconnected from the context. It was not me.**

My friends and my circle were aware of my episode. I was also aware. But the awareness
did not help because there was something wrong and it was controlling me.
I already left my job at that moment. I let it to control me; because there was no way to back.
I wanted to let it go and just acted without over-thinking. I went for camping, hiking,
I tried to be alone and stay away from my social circle.

I went to my home-town and stayed with my family. I told them to take me to hospital
and they did. I am taking a therapy and they prescribed some mood stabilizers
and drugs to me. After a month, currently, I feel normal again and writing these notes.
I don't know what will happen next, but I feel comfortable with the treatment.
I don't want it to happen again.

### I am sorry

What I wrote and talked was not binding to any context and I did not have bad
intention to express them. I wanted them to be out; I don't know why. As I said,
It was not me and it is not me. I apology.

I am sorry; but there is no way back. I need to live with what happened and take it as a lesson.

### It is a tragic event, not funny
Although, humor was a tool to cope with my episode. The only way to deal with the shame
and guilt is acceptance and watching it as a different person than you are. It helped me
to control myself and draw a plan for my future.

### Life was going on and I did not stop
Social skill was not relevant at that moment; because I had to avoid communication.
I shifted my focus to hard-skills. I read lots of programming books and written code.
I developed a lot of side projects. I utilized my time to fulfill my technical gaps.
I feel like I am back on track again; but I am also aware that I have to wait a
little more to watch myself.

I think, in a bigger picture, my episodes help me to understand myself better.
Understanding myself will help to improve my social skills. I have no other chance
than taking that incident as a lesson and continue to my life.

Thanks for reading my notes. I wish good luck and patience to the folks who is
sharing the same faith with me :) We deserve to be loved, to be taken seriously,
to be social again. I hope everything will be nice again.
